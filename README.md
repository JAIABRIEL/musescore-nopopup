# musescore-nopopup

## Description

Hide "Please rate this score" popup on MuseScore.com which appears on every sheet when scrolled to the end. I wasn't able to remove the review popup which appears when closing the download dialog but I highly recommend [musescore-downloader](https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader) by [Xmader](https://github.com/Xmader), so the default options are overwritten anyway.

## Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox).
2. Install script from [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/424427-musescore-nopopup) ([direct](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/424427-musescore-nopopup/code/musescore-nopopup.user.js)).
